Lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in various fields due to their advantages such as high specific energy, use in a wide range of temperatures, low self-discharge rate, long cycle life, good safety performance, and no pollution. In addition, the replacement of conventional diesel vehicles with new energy vehicles using lithium-ion batteries as energy systems has also been gradually tried all over the world. At present, however, commonly used positive active materials such as lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) and low-nickel ternary materials (LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2) cannot fully meet requirements of lithium-ion batteries for energy density due to inherent limitations of the materials. Energy density of lithium-ion batteries can be improved by increasing nickel content of the ternary material. Therefore, high-nickel ternary materials are currently one of main research subjects of positive active materials for lithium-ion batteries. However, with the increase of the nickel content, side reactions between the ternary material and an electrolyte also increase significantly, which causes severe gas production in the lithium-ion batteries. This is currently one of biggest bottlenecks in commercial mass production of high-nickel ternary materials.\nCurrently, at a material level, methods for alleviating the gassing problem of lithium-ion batteries mainly include reducing nickel content in the ternary material and washing to reduce residual lithium content on a surface of the positive active material. However, these methods all cause different degrees of damage to performance of the lithium-ion batteries, for example, reduced reversible capacity per gram of the lithium-ion batteries, and deteriorated cycle performance.\nTherefore, effective technical methods are needed to allow lithium-ion batteries to have higher energy density to meet increasingly stringent application requirements, while decreasing gas production of the lithium-ion batteries and improving storage performance of the lithium-ion batteries.\nSUMMARY\nIn view of the problems existing in the background, an objective of this application is to provide a positive active material, a positive electrode plate, an electrochemical energy storage apparatus, and an apparatus. This application can effectively reduce side reactions between the positive active material and an electrolyte, decrease gas production of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus, and improve storage performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus without deteriorating energy density, cycle performance and rate performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus.\nTo achieve the foregoing objective, one aspect of this application provides a positive active material. The positive active material is LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm or LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm whose surface is provided with a coating layer, where 0.85≤x≤1.15, 0<y<1, 0<z<1, 0<k<1, 0≤p≤0.1, 1≤r≤2, 0≤m≤1, m+r≤2, M is one or two selected from Mn and Al, Me is one or more selected from Zr, Zn, Cu, Cr, Mg, Fe, V, Ti, Sr, Sb, Y, W, and Nb, and A is one or more selected from N, F, S, and Cl. The positive active material is secondary particles, and a particle size D   n10 of the positive active material satisfies: 0.5 μm≤D   n10≤3 μm.\nAccording to another aspect of this application, this application provides a positive electrode plate, where the positive electrode plate includes the positive active material in the one aspect of this application.\nAccording to still another aspect of this application, this application provides an electrochemical energy storage apparatus, where the electrochemical energy storage apparatus includes the aforementioned positive active material.\nAccording to yet another aspect of this application, this application provides an apparatus, where the apparatus is a vehicle and includes the aforementioned electrochemical energy storage apparatus.\nThe beneficial effects of this application include the following:\nIn this application, particle morphology of the positive active material and the amount of micro powder in the positive active material are properly controlled, to effectively reduce side reactions between the positive active material and an electrolyte, decrease gas production of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus, and improve storage performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus without deteriorating energy density, cycle performance and rate performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus. The apparatus in this application includes the electrochemical energy storage apparatus, and therefore has at least the same advantages as the electrochemical energy storage apparatus.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\n FIG. 1  is a differential volume-based particle size distribution curve of a positive active material in Comparative Example 1 of this application;\n FIG. 2  is a differential number-based particle size distribution curve of a positive active material in Comparative Example 1 of this application;\n FIG. 3  is a differential volume-based particle size distribution curve of a positive active material in Example 3 of this application;\n FIG. 4  is a differential number-based particle size distribution curve of a positive active material in Example 3 of this application;\n FIG. 5  is a perspective view of an embodiment of an electrochemical energy storage apparatus;\n FIG. 6  is a perspective view of an embodiment of a battery module;\n FIG. 7  is a perspective view of an embodiment of a battery pack;\n FIG. 8  is an exploded view of FIG. 7 ; and\n FIG. 9  is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of an apparatus using an electrochemical energy storage apparatus as a power supply.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF REFERENCE SIGNS\n\n \n\n\n 1. battery pack\n 2. upper box body\n 3. lower box body\n 4. battery module\n 5. electrochemical energy storage apparatus\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS\nThe following describes in detail a positive active material and a preparation method thereof, a positive electrode plate, an electrochemical energy storage apparatus, and an apparatus in this application.\nFirst described is the positive active material according to the first aspect of this application.\nThe positive active material according to the first aspect of this application is LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm or LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm whose surface is provided with a coating layer, where 0.85≤x≤1.15, 0<y<1, 0<z<1, 0<k<1, 0≤p≤0.1, 1≤r≤2, 0≤m≤1, m+r≤2, M is one or two selected from Mn and Al, Me is one or more selected from Zr, Zn, Cu, Cr, Mg, Fe, V, Ti, Sr, Sb, Y, W, and Nb, and A is one or more selected from N, F, S, and Cl.\nIn an actual production process of a ternary material, due to problems of possible impurity and a low melting point of a raw material lithium salt used, melting, decomposition and volatilization loss may occur on the raw material lithium salt at a relatively low temperature. Therefore, in a process of preparing the ternary material, excessive lithium salt is added to compensate for lithium loss caused during a sintering process. A surface of the ternary material has active oxygen anions, which react with CO2 and H2O in the air to form carbonate. Meanwhile, lithium ions migrate from an original location to the surface and form Li2CO3 on the surface of the ternary material. This process is accompanied by deoxidization of the surface of the ternary material to form a distorted-surface oxide layer. In addition, adding the excessive lithium salt during synthesis of the ternary material results in that main products of the excessive lithium salt calcined at high temperature are oxides of Li. The oxides of Li react with CO2 and H2O in the air to form LiOH and Li2CO3, which remain on the surface of the ternary material, resulting in a relatively high pH value of the ternary material. In addition, during a charging and discharging process, Li2CO3 remaining on the surface of the ternary material decomposes to generate CO2. Because the CO2 gas causes a pressure difference due to a temperature difference (especially when a reaction process is accompanied by a thermal reaction), swelling of an electrochemical energy storage apparatus is aggravated, and storage performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus is deteriorated.\nProviding a coating layer on a surface of LiNiyCozMkMepOrAm can reduce residual lithium content (such as LiOH or Li2CO3) on the surface of the positive active material to a specific extent, and achieve the purpose of improving storage performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus. In addition, providing a coating layer on a surface of LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm can also reduce a probability of side reactions caused due to direct contact between LiNiyCozMkMepOrAm and an electrolyte, thereby further reducing the amount of oxygen released for balancing charges by the positive active material during the charging and discharging process, and reducing a crystal structure collapse risk arising therefrom. The Li2CO3 content on the surface of the positive active material obtained by providing a coating layer on the surface of LiNiyCozMkMepOrAm is less than that of LiOH. In some embodiments, on the surface of the positive active material obtained by providing a coating layer on the surface of LiNiyCozMkMepOrAm, the Li2CO3 content is less than 3000 ppm, and the LiOH content is less than 5000 ppm.\nThe positive active material in the first aspect of this application is in morphology of secondary particles, and a particle size D   n10 of the positive active material satisfies: 0.5 μm≤D   n10≤3 μm. In some embodiments, the particle size D   n10 of the positive active material satisfies: 1 μm≤D   n10≤2 μm.\nAn energy density, storage performance, cycle performance and rate performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus are closely associated with physical and chemical properties of the positive active material. The ternary material is a positive active material that mainly includes transition metal elements Ni and Co adjacent to each other in a same period, and achieves a charge balance through changes in valence states of Ni and Co. Ni is one of main active metal elements, and mainly in the form of +2 valence. In a process of deintercalating lithium, Ni2+ is oxidized to Ni3+ and Ni4+. Co is also one of the active metal elements, and mainly in the form of +3 valence. In a process of deintercalating lithium, Co3+ is oxidized to Co4+. Therefore, in a process of deintercalating lithium, the ternary material mainly achieves the charge balance through changes in valence states of Ni and Co. As proportions of Ni and Co change, the energy density, storage performance, cycle performance and rate performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus change to different degrees.\nIn the ternary material, higher Ni content usually indicates larger capacity per gram of the ternary material, and is more helpful in increasing the energy density of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus. However, when the Ni content in the ternary material is relatively high, a layered structure of the ternary material collapses due to mixing of Ni2+ and Li+, making it more difficult to deintercalate Li+ in the ternary material, and ultimately leading to deterioration of the cycle performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus. An increase of the Ni content in the ternary material further reduces a thermal decomposition temperature of the ternary material, resulting in an increase in the amount of heat release and deterioration of thermal stability of the ternary material. When the Ni content in the ternary material increases, the amount of Ni4+ with strong oxidizability also increases. When the electrolyte comes into contact with the ternary material, more side reactions between the electrolyte and the ternary material occur, and in order to maintain the charge balance, the ternary material releases oxygen. This not only destroys a crystal structure of the ternary material, but also aggravates the swelling of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus and deteriorates the storage performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus.\nCompared with a positive active material of a large particle size, a specific surface area of a positive active material of a small particle size is larger, a contact area between the positive active material of the small particle size and the electrolyte is increased, and more side reactions may occur when the positive active material is in contact with the electrolyte. In order to maintain the charge balance, the positive active material of the small particle size may release more oxygen, which may not only destroy the crystal structure of the ternary material, but also aggravate the swelling of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus and deteriorate the storage performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus. Meanwhile, the positive active material with the small particle size is weak in compression resistance and is more likely to be crushed and produce more primary particles during the cold pressing of an electrode plate. A part of the primary particles may fall off from a positive current collector because the part of the primary particles is not in contact with a binder, and a part of the primary particles may locally deteriorate the performance of the positive electrode plate because this part is not in contact with a conductive agent.\nIn addition, generally, for a positive active material with a wide range of particle size distribution, a volume percentage of powder of a small particle size, especially micro powder, in the positive active material is insignificant. Therefore, a conventional volume particle size used to express the amount of micro powder content in the positive active material is relatively rough, and a number particle size used to express the amount of micro powder content in the positive active material is more accurate and intuitive, which is helpful in properly controlling the swelling of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus.\nTherefore, in comprehensive consideration of impact of the foregoing factors on the energy density, storage performance, cycle performance and rate performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus, the positive active material as described in the first aspect of this application is a ternary material in morphology of secondary particles: LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm or LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm whose surface is provided with a coating layer, with the particle size D   n10 satisfying 0.5 μm≤D   n10≤3 μm. Particle morphology of the positive active material and the amount of micro powder in the positive active material are properly controlled, to effectively reduce side reactions between the positive active material and the electrolyte, decrease gas production of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus, and improve storage performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus without deteriorating energy density, cycle performance and rate performance of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus.\nIn some embodiments, in LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm, 0.50≤y≤0.90, 0.05≤z≤0.2, 0.05≤k≤0.4, and 0≤p≤0.05.\nIn some further embodiments, in LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm, 0.70≤y≤0.90, 0.05≤z≤0.2, 0.05≤k≤0.2, and 0≤p≤0.05. For a ternary material with higher nickel content (0.70≤y≤0.90), a relative amount of micro powder of a small particle size has more significant impact on residual lithium content and gassing problem of the positive active material. Therefore, controlling D   n10 of the high-nickel secondary-particle-morphological ternary material LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm or LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm whose surface is provided with a coating layer to be within 0.5 μm to 3 μm is an effective means to solve the gassing problem.\nSpecifically, LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm may be LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2, LiNi0.5Co0.25Mn0.25O2, LiNi0.55Co0.15Mn0.3O2, LiNi0.55Co0.1Mn0.35O2, LiNi0.55Co0.05Mn0.4O2, LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2, LiNi0.75Co0.1Mn0.15O2, LiNi0.5Co0.1Mn0.1O2, LiNi0.55Co0.05Mn0.1O2, LiNi0.55Co0.05Mn0.07O2, or LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2, or may be a substance obtained through modification by partially substituting the foregoing substance with the doping element Me and/or the doping element A.\nIn the positive active material according to the first aspect of this application, coating the surface of LiNiyCozMkMepOrAm can avoid direct contact between LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm and the electrolyte, and reduce side reactions between the positive active material and the electrolyte. In some embodiments, a coating element in the coating layer is selected from one or a combination of more of Al, Ba, Zn, Ti, Co, W, Y, Si, Sn, B, and P. In some further embodiments, a coating element in the coating layer is selected from a combination of two or more of Al, Ba, Zn, Ti, Co, W, Y, Si, Sn, B, and P.\nIn some embodiments, the coating layer includes an oxide of the foregoing coating element. In some further embodiments, the coating layer includes oxides formed by two or more of the foregoing coating elements. When the coating layer includes oxides formed by the at least two coating elements, stability of adhesion of the coating layer to the surface of LixNiyCozMkMepOrAm can be improved, so that the coating layer has a specific degree of ion conductivity and electron conductivity, thereby mitigating impact of the coating layer on polarization of the positive active material.\nIn the positive active material in the first aspect of this application, the particle size D   n10 of the positive active material measured in μm and a particle size D   v10 of the positive active material measured in μm satisfy: 1≤D   n10×D   v10≤20. In some further embodiments, the particle size D   n10 of the positive active material measured in μm and the particle size D   v10 of the positive active material measured in μm satisfy: 2≤D   n10×D   v10≤18. D   v10 is a corresponding particle size when a cumulative volume distribution percentage of the positive active material reaches 10%, and D   n10 is a corresponding particle size when a cumulative number distribution percentage of the positive active material reaches 10%. When a product of D   n10 and D   v10 of the positive active material is within the foregoing range, it indicates that a relative amount of micro powder of an excessively small particle size in the positive active material is relatively small, and that the capacity of the positive active material is relatively high. This is helpful in alleviating the gassing problem of the positive active material while ensuring that a volumetric energy density of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus is relatively high.\nIn some embodiments, the particle size D   v10 of the positive active material is 2 μm to 8 μm. In some further embodiments, the particle size D   v10 of the positive active material is 3 μm to 6 μm.\nIn the positive active material according to the first aspect of this application, a theoretical specific surface area BET1 of the positive active material and an actual specific surface area BET2 of the positive active material satisfy: 0.8≤(BET2−BET1)/BET1≤5.5.\nThe theoretical specific surface area of the positive active material BET1=6/(ρ×Dv50). ρ is an actual density of the positive active material, measured in g/cm3. Dv50 is a corresponding particle size when the cumulative volume distribution percentage of the positive active material reaches 50%, measured in μm.\nThe actual specific surface area BET2 of the positive active material can be measured by using the N2 adsorption method. For details, refer to GB/T19587-2004.\nIn this application, (BET2−BET1)/BET1 represents a degree of deviation between the theoretical specific surface area and the actual specific surface area of the positive active material, which can measure a degree of unevenness on the surface of the positive active material. Controlling the degree of deviation between the theoretical specific surface area and the actual specific surface area of the positive active material to be within a specific range can ensure that the surface of the positive active material having the secondary particle morphology is relatively flat, with fewer unevenness structures, and can indicate that primary particles forming the secondary particles have good uniformity in particle size. This is helpful in reducing the polarization of the positive active material, improving ion transport performance, further decreasing the gas production, and optimizing dynamic performance.\nIn some embodiments, the actual specific surface area BET2 of the positive active material is 0.1 m2/g to 0.8 m2/g. When the actual specific surface area of the positive active material is within the foregoing range, a contact area between the electrolyte and the positive active material is relatively small, which is helpful in inhibiting side reactions, avoiding corrosion damage of the electrolyte to the crystal structure of the positive active material, and thereby avoiding aggravating the gassing problem of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus. In addition, when the actual specific surface area of the positive active material is within the foregoing range, it is further helpful in achieving relatively strong adhesion of the binder and the conductive agent to the positive active material with fewer auxiliary materials in making a positive slurry through mixing, thereby helping to increase the energy density of the electrochemical energy storage apparatus.\nIn some embodiments, the particle size Dv50 of the positive active material is 5 μm to 8 μm. In some further embodiments, the particle size Dv50 of the positive active material is 8 μm to 15 μm.\nIn some embodiments, a particle size Dv90 of the positive active material is 10 μm to 30 μm. In some further embodiments, the particle size Dv90 of the positive active material is 12 μm to 25 μm.\nIn the positive active material according to the first aspect of this application, a differential particle size distribution curve of the positive active material has one and only one peak.

In some embodiments, the graded screening may be air flow graded screening or sieve-based screening.\nA specific process of the air flow graded screening is as follows: The sintered material is put into an air flow classifier, and then ejected from a nozzle with an air flow of a specific pressure; particles are separated by size by using the principle that particles of different sizes have inconsistent weights, where a particle with smaller weight flies closer, while a particle with larger weight flies farther. A distance between a collector and the nozzle is adjusted to find particles with an appropriate particle size, thereby obtaining the positive active material.\nA specific process of the sieve-based screening is as follows: The sintered material is sifted using a 200- to 1000-mesh sieve. Due to different particle sizes of the particles, particles with a small particle size will pass through the sieve, and those with a required particle size can be retained on the sieve, thereby obtaining the positive active material.

The method includes the following steps: S.

In some embodiments, the graded screening may be air flow graded screening or sieve-based screening.\nA specific process of the air flow graded screening is as follows: The secondarily sintered material is put into an air flow classifier, and then ejected from a nozzle with an air flow of a specific pressure; particles are separated by size by using the principle that particles of different sizes have inconsistent weights, where a particle with smaller weight flies closer, while a particle with larger weight flies farther.

After that, the volume of the lithium-ion battery was measured again by using the drainage method, recorded as a volume of the lithium-ion battery after 10 days storage at 80° C.\n\nVolume swelling rate (%) of the lithium-ion battery after 10 days storage at 80° C.=[Volume of the lithium-ion battery after 10 days storage at 80° C./Initial volume of the lithium-ion battery−1]×100%.\n\n(4) Capacity Test for the Positive Active Material of the Lithium-Ion Battery\nThe lithium-ion battery was kept still in a constant temperature environment of 25° C. for 2 hours, then charged to 4.2V at ⅓C under 2.8V to 4.2V, then charged with a constant voltage of 4.2V to a current less than or equal to 0.05 mA, kept still for 5 min, and then discharged to 2.8V at 1 C. Capacity of the lithium-ion battery at this point was recorded, and the measured capacity was divided by the mass of the positive active material in the battery to obtain capacity of the positive active material in the lithium-ion battery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n \n\n\nParameters of the positive active materials in Examples\n\n\n1 to 10 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(BET2 −\n \n\n\n \nDn10\nDv10\nDv50\nBET2 \nBET1)/\nCoating\n\n\n \n(μm)\n(μm)\n(μm)\n(m2/g)\nBET1 \nsubstance\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n0.5\n5.0\n9\n0.8\n4.6\n/\n\n\nExample 2\n1.5\n7.5\n14\n0.5\n4.5\n/\n\n\nExample 3\n1.8\n5.1\n16\n0.18\n1.3\n/\n\n\nExample 4\n1.5\n3.4\n8\n0.34\n1.1\n/\n\n\nExample 5\n2.5\n5.6\n12\n0.5\n3.7\n/\n\n\nExample 6\n3.0\n6.0\n18\n0.35\n3.9\n/\n\n\nExample 7\n1.5\n7.5\n16\n0.49\n5.1\n/\n\n\nExample 8\n0.5\n2.0\n5\n0.48\n0.9\n/\n\n\nExample 9\n1.1\n3.7\n11\n0.55\n3.7\nAl2O3 \n\n\nExample 10\n2.4\n4.8\n13\n0.45\n3.6\nB2O3 \n\n\nComparative\n0.2\n2.5\n10\n0.6\n3.7\n/\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n Comparative \n4\n4.4\n10\n0.5\n2.9\n/\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPerformance test results of Examples 1\n\n\nto 10 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCapacity\n \nVolume\n\n\n \n \n \nof positive\n \nswelling rate\n\n\n \nLi2CO3 \nLiOH\nactive\nNumber\nafter 10\n\n\n \ncontent\ncontent\nmaterial\nof cycles\ndays storage\n\n\n \n(ppm)\n(ppm)\n(mAh/g)\nat 45° C.\nat 80° C.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n2354\n3451\n196\n1232\n99%\n\n\nExample 2\n2234\n3612\n195\n1182\n94%\n\n\nExample 3\n2131\n3588\n194\n1124\n93%\n\n\nExample 4\n2554\n3821\n196\n1198\n95%\n\n\nExample 5\n2764\n3353\n196\n1218\n89%\n\n\nExample 6\n2481\n3221\n194\n1198\n87%\n\n\nExample 7\n2341\n4312\n194\n854\n105% \n\n\nExample 8\n2651\n4231\n196\n989\n115% \n\n\nExample 9\n2412\n1831\n195\n1287\n78%\n\n\nExample 10\n1531\n1952\n196\n1098\n86%\n\n\nComparative\n3452\n4525\n194\n894\n154% \n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nComparative\n2324\n3821\n192\n951\n125% \n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be learned from analysis of the test results in Table 2 that in the positive active materials for the lithium-ion batteries of Examples 1 to 10, there was a small relative amount of micro powder with a particle size less than 1 μm in the positive active material, and the positive active material had higher capacity. In addition, the lithium-ion battery had a longer high-temperature cycle life and a lower high-temperature storage volume swelling rate. Therefore, properly controlling particle morphology of the positive active material and the amount of micro powder in the positive active material could effectively reduce side reactions between the positive active material and the electrolyte, decrease gas production of the lithium-ion battery, and improve storage performance of the lithium-ion battery without deteriorating energy density, cycle performance and rate performance of the lithium-ion battery.\nIt could also be found, through further analysis of test results of Examples 1 to 8, that controlling a degree of deviation between a theoretical specific surface area BET1 and an actual specific surface area BET2 of the positive active material could further optimize a micro structure of the positive active material, to ensure a relative flat surface of the positive active material formed with fewer uneven structures. This was helpful in reducing the polarization of the positive active material and improving the transport of ions, thereby further decreasing the gas production of the lithium-ion battery and optimizing kinetic performance of the lithium-ion battery.\nCompared with Example 1, the positive active material in Examples 9 and 10 was Li(Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1)0.997Zr0.003O2 with coating on its surface. Coating the surface of Li(Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1)0.997Zr0.003O2 could avoid direct contact between Li(Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1)0.997Zr0.003O2 and the electrolyte, and reduce the probability of side reactions between the positive active material and the electrolyte. In addition, a coating layer of Al2O3 and B2O3 had good ion conductivity and electron conductivity, which could alleviate the gassing problem while minimizing impact of the coating layer on the polarization of the positive active material.\nIn Comparative Example 1, D   n10 of the positive active material was further reduced. It can be found, from the differential volume-based particle size distribution curve and the differential number-based particle size distribution curve in FIG. 1  and FIG. 2 , that the particle size distribution curves of the positive active material both had two peaks. A possible reason was an excessive relative amount of micro powder in the positive active material. With reference to FIG. 3  and FIG. 4 , it can be learned that the differential volume-based particle size distribution curve and the differential number-based particle size distribution curve of the positive active material in this application were both unimodal, indicating a small relative amount of micro powder in the positive active material. When the relative amount of micro powder in the positive active material was too large, because a specific surface area of the micro powder was larger, the amount of residual lithium on the surface was larger, and a contact area with the electrolyte was larger. As such, more side reactions would take place when the positive active material came into contact with the electrolyte. In order to maintain the charge balance, the micro-power positive active material released more oxygen, which not only destroyed the crystal structure of the positive active material, but also aggravated the swelling of the lithium-ion battery and deteriorated the storage performance of the lithium-ion battery.\nIn Comparative Example 2, D   n10 of the positive active material was 4 μm. In this case, there was less micro powder content in the positive active material was, but due to the fact that Dv50 needed to be kept within a specific range to maintain good transport of ions, the particle size distribution of the positive active material was narrow, and many pores were present between particles of the positive active material in the positive electrode plate, and it was difficult to achieve high compaction density. In addition, during the cold pressing of the positive electrode plate, particles of the positive active material are more likely to be crushed, which might not only affect the energy density of the lithium ion battery but also aggravate the swelling of the lithium ion battery.",
