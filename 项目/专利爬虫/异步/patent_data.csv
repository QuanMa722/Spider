Method and system for classifying detected events as labeled event combinations for processing at a client application,US11887712B2,"Technologies are provided for classifying detected events as labeled event combinations. Input data for different combinations of detected events are received at a server system, and each combination of detected events is processed at the server system. Processing can include classifying that combination of detected events at a classifier to map that combination of detected events to a probability of an increased insulin delivery demand or a probability of a decreased insulin delivery demand, and labeling each classified combination of detected events with a label to generate a corresponding labeled event combination that has the probability of the increased insulin delivery demand or the probability of the decreased insulin delivery demand. Each labeled event combination can be stored in storage as a database of labeled event combinations, and selected ones of the labeled event combinations can be processed at a client application to generate an output result.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/79/06/e8/a704718ae4d17f/US11887712-20240130-D00000.png,

Protein markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of ovarian and breast cancer,US8187889B2,"Plasma samples of ovarian and breast cancer patients were used to search for markers of cancer, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. Truncated forms of cytosolic serine hydroxymethyl transferase (cSHMT), T-box transcription factor 3 (Tbx3) and utrophin were aberrantly expressed in samples from cancer patients, as compared to samples from noncancer cases. Aberrant expression of proteins was validated by immunoblotting of plasma samples with specific antibodies to cSHMT, Tbx3 and utrophin. A cohort of 79 breast and 39 ovarian cancer patients, and 31 individuals who were either healthy or had noncancerous conditions was studied. We observed increased expression of truncated cSHMT, Tbx3 and utrophin in plasma samples obtained from patients at early stages of disease. The results indicate that cSHMT, Tbx3, utrophin and truncated forms thereof can be used as components of multiparameter monitoring of ovarian and breast cancer.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c4/06/84/d91a658f806667/US08187889-20120529-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f6/7b/10/83e9d4e1064085/US08187889-20120529-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/60/4b/89/17841330b691f9/US08187889-20120529-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/31/fc/9f/13de9c539abb86/US08187889-20120529-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e7/5b/72/0cf4498a1da28e/US08187889-20120529-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/71/04/c3/e177e6a2d70941/US08187889-20120529-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/31/51/09/dcccb583dd17e1/US08187889-20120529-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/5d/0f/e7/291e87255a382b/US08187889-20120529-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ef/5c/13/e75959530d1b26/US08187889-20120529-D00008.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7d/40/67/d1d5bc32c6669a/US08187889-20120529-D00009.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/26/85/c9/e879484459ad37/US08187889-20120529-D00010.png","Marta Lomnytska, Anna Dubrovska, Ulf Hellman, Nataliya Volodko, Serhiy Souchelnytskyi","Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Ltd, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research New York","2007-07-27: Application filed by Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research New York, 2008-09-04: Priority to US11/829,360, 2012-04-30: Publication of US20080213907A1, 2012-05-04: Assigned to LUDWIG INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH LTD., 2012-05-29: Application granted, Status: Publication of US8187889B2, 2027-07-27: Expired - Fee Related, 2012-01-31: Anticipated expiration","G, G01, G01N, G01N33/00, G01N33/48, G01N33/50, G01N33/53, G01N33/574, G01N33/57407, G01N33/57415, G, G01, G01N, G01N33/00, G01N33/48, G01N33/50, G01N33/53, G01N33/574, G01N33/57407, G01N33/57449, G, G01, G01N, G01N2333/00, G01N2333/90, G01N2333/91, G01N2333/91005, G01N2333/91028, G, G01, G01N, G01N2800/00, G01N2800/28, G01N2800/2878, G01N2800/2885, G, G01, G01N, G01N2800/00, G01N2800/52","G—PHYSICSG01—MEASURING;

Telephone number allocation and management in a wireless access point,US7302255B1,"A method for a WLAN access point to allocate telephone numbers for use by mobile stations. The access point includes stored data indicating one or more allowed telephone numbers. When a mobile station associated with the access point and acquires an IP address, the mobiles station sends a telephone number allocation-request to the access point, seeking allocation of a particular telephone number for use by the mobile station. If the telephone requested number is one of those allowed, then the access point associates the telephone number with the mobile station. On the other hand, if the requested telephone number is not one of those allowed, then the access point provides the mobile station with a list of the available telephone numbers, to allow a user to select a desired telephone number, and the mobile station may then send a new telephone number allocation-request, seeking allocation of the selected telephone number.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/b7/aa/c2/c1a25c47882122/US07302255-20071127-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a2/4d/7f/09292e4453c72b/US07302255-20071127-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/15/fe/10/0a80e3e974639d/US07302255-20071127-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/b2/1b/12/67902a72b90cba/US07302255-20071127-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d6/e1/db/0e9d6d7e2d44c4/US07302255-20071127-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/18/79/f2/6a00b5d505bb18/US07302255-20071127-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c9/dd/3f/6c6dda33dcf595/US07302255-20071127-D00006.png","Michael T.

"Melanocortin-3 receptor deficient cells, non-human transgenic animals and methods of selecting compounds which regulate body weight",US7321074B1,"Cells and non-human transgenic animals have been engineered to be deficient in the gene encoding the melcanocortin-3 receptor protein (MC-3R). MC-3R deficient transgenic animals have increased fatmass and reduced lean body mass, showing that the MC-3R protein is involved in the regulation of body fat and muscle mass. These MC-3R deficient transgenic animals can be used to select for and test potential modulators of MC-3R. This data allows for methods of screening for MC-3R modulators which effect body weight and associated methods of treating various disorders associated with inappropriate regulation of body weight. The disclosure also relates to a MC-3R/MC-4R double knockout mouse which can be used to select for and test potential modulators (e.g., agonists or antagonists) of MC-3R and/or MC-4R. It is shown that MC-3R serves a non-redundant role, when compared to MC-4R, in the regulation of energy homeostasis.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/23/54/6b/e5a02f296d3d81/US07321074-20080122-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/4a/3d/c9/f69a513ce72d3f/US07321074-20080122-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f5/8b/b1/421f96adc4e75e/US07321074-20080122-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/bb/f0/89/1f49004cd25b8a/US07321074-20080122-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a4/dd/4d/60ef453f3a30fa/US07321074-20080122-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/70/06/36/3b45ab3ed24e38/US07321074-20080122-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/89/10/18/09700726b67bf0/US07321074-20080122-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6b/33/70/21a6470afb7439/US07321074-20080122-D00008.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a5/85/e0/11abfe2318154a/US07321074-20080122-D00009.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a4/d3/80/51d85b65cd64cd/US07321074-20080122-D00010.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c2/47/39/b565717e55f5be/US07321074-20080122-D00011.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c5/01/0c/280ccc02f2030a/US07321074-20080122-D00012.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/91/aa/e2/34f1f8278a37fb/US07321074-20080122-D00013.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/31/40/cd/0907d0744dfe38/US07321074-20080122-D00014.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ed/a1/0a/a6c46521d7a98f/US07321074-20080122-D00015.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/b8/86/4d/70f2deee934c0f/US07321074-20080122-D00016.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/fc/07/10/1f95934af7cde7/US07321074-20080122-D00017.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e6/8d/47/f58a6043c2c9a9/US07321074-20080122-D00018.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d9/b7/99/c9f540e5b78d24/US07321074-20080122-D00019.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/99/d6/6c/ae0a7b0aac7dd4/US07321074-20080122-D00020.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/73/f3/dd/1031a912825f5f/US07321074-20080122-D00021.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/10/5d/cd/f45dd1cad72898/US07321074-20080122-D00022.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/80/a0/81/b39cc256066d76/US07321074-20080122-D00023.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/92/b1/36/fc0730401da1df/US07321074-20080122-D00024.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c2/08/da/b421310ef112e2/US07321074-20080122-D00025.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c7/88/05/cfa8928eeb2ead/US07321074-20080122-D00026.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/82/25/92/175a6dd6f68b9a/US07321074-20080122-D00027.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/22/aa/47/921fc893fb541b/US07321074-20080122-D00028.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1e/25/b6/d3414ba8568fe2/US07321074-20080122-D00029.png","Leonardus H.

Thus, the backlash in the rotation direction of the leaf spring 4 can be reduced by providing the positioning protrusion 4 c and the engaging hole 5 b.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1c/ec/62/197b59d25dbc95/US08429796-20130430-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/bf/f8/a3/6b6e2549c34b9e/US08429796-20130430-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/58/26/15/f76ed87a521081/US08429796-20130430-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/03/27/3a/123aa377f6bc76/US08429796-20130430-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f2/7c/1d/3374a2b36c1103/US08429796-20130430-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ef/ba/b2/2a94272a97e87a/US08429796-20130430-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/4e/c5/55/fa2e8f30052b65/US08429796-20130430-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/53/66/d8/06c749ba32b287/US08429796-20130430-D00007.png",Tetsuro Nagami,Mitsubishi Electric Corp,"2009-09-25: Tilt hinge, 2011-02-24: Adjusted expiration, 2011-06-30: Assigned to MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORPORATION, 2013-04-30: Application granted, Status: Publication of US8429796B2, 2030-01-26: Expired - Fee Related","B, B60, B60R, B60R11/00, B60R11/02, B60R11/0229, B60R11/0235, B, B60, B60R, B60R11/00, B60R2011/0001, B60R2011/0003, B60R2011/0028, B, B60, B60R, B60R11/00, B60R2011/0042, B60R2011/008, B60R2011/0082","B—PERFORMING OPERATIONS;

Gasket-end feature for sealing a T-joint assembly,US8342538B2,"A t-joint assembly includes a gasket having first and second ends, and a substantially elongated body having a profile. The first end includes an enlarged tapered section having a distal tip and a force-transfer surface disposed substantially perpendicular to the body. The assembly also includes a first component having a channel with a profile and a reaction surface configured to respectively complement the profile and accept the force-transfer surface of the gasket. The first component also has a first sealing surface arranged substantially parallel to the reaction surface, and a second sealing surface arranged substantially perpendicular to the reaction surface. The t-joint assembly additionally includes second and third components, each having a sealing surface.

Low cost trigger sprayer,US10159997B2,"A trigger sprayer has a housing, a piston bore within the housing, and a piston reciprocally mounted within the piston bore. The housing further includes a flow passage through which liquid passes from a passage inlet to a passage outlet. An actuator is operable to reciprocate the piston within the piston bore between a vacuum stroke creating reduced pressure in the piston bore and a compression stroke creating increased pressure in the piston bore. A valve assembly within the flow passage controls the flow of liquid through the flow passage upon operation of the actuator. The valve assembly further comprises a check valve and a priming valve. The sprayer has a closure for mounting the sprayer to a container. The valve seat for the check valve is in a component formed separately from and operatively connected to the housing.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/dc/4a/b7/1ff33423f01534/US10159997-20181225-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/45/df/ba/a3a7ce68f7b311/US10159997-20181225-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e0/69/1f/80c2e202eb5025/US10159997-20181225-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/3e/75/7c/eb06ca8279cbb4/US10159997-20181225-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/4b/3a/bd/fa7bd61450137b/US10159997-20181225-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/3e/bd/b3/bfd2f6ef0e0806/US10159997-20181225-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/cf/69/71/77276f1a4b6f2d/US10159997-20181225-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/25/40/ee/e6a3896915af94/US10159997-20181225-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/13/1c/cc/eb878e938d3c87/US10159997-20181225-D00008.png","Donald D.

Encapsulated active ingredients for controlled enteric release,US9867809B2,"A method of forming a granule having an internal three-dimensional framework of channels to control and sustain the release of an active ingredient for enteric delivery of the active ingredient in an animal fed the granule. In the composition of the granules hydrogenated vegetable oil, HVO for example, is combined with a modifier to create a granule with channels through which the active ingredient is released. The active ingredients, including but not limited to metal salts of butyric acid, can be released in the lower gut of the animal where it will best benefit the animal. By adjusting the amount of the modifier, the release rate of the active can be adjusted to suit the passage rate of the species of animal being fed.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/b4/cc/19/78ad67d46aa843/US09867809-20180116-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/87/48/28/5fe80ef707f81f/US09867809-20180116-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c2/3b/a9/7fc0f84cad498f/US09867809-20180116-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6f/68/8c/b2f2e2d7bec30b/US09867809-20180116-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/01/82/72/fe08aac366e995/US09867809-20180116-D00004.png","Mitchell Poss, Thoai Pham, David Sanders, Jon Rubach, Shulin Feng",Kemin Industries Inc,"2016-06-30: Application filed by Kemin Industries Inc, 2016-09-14: Anticipated expiration, 2017-01-05: Assigned to KEMIN INDUSTRIES, INC., 2018-01-16: Application granted, 2021-07-12: Publication of US9867809B2, Status: Assigned to BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, 2036-06-30: Active","A, A61, A61K, A61K31/00, A61K31/33, A61K31/395, A61K31/41, A61K31/4164, A61K31/4172, A, A61, A61K, A61K31/00, A, A61, A61K, A61K31/00, A61K31/185, A61K31/19, A, A61, A61K, A61K9/00, A61K9/0012, A61K9/0053, A61K9/0056, A, A61, A61K, A61K9/00, A61K9/14, A61K9/16, A61K9/1605, A61K9/1611, A, A61, A61K, A61K9/00, A61K9/14, A61K9/16, A61K9/1605, A61K9/1617, A, A61, A61K, A61K9/00, A61K9/14, A61K9/16, A61K9/1605, A61K9/1617, A61K9/1623, A, A61, A61K, A61K9/00, A61K9/14, A61K9/16, A61K9/1682, A61K9/1694","A—HUMAN NECESSITIESA61—MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE;

Dual contra-wound helical antenna for a communication device,US10910725B2,"An antenna is provided having a primary helical coil (102) and a secondary helical coil (104) contra-wound relative to the primary helical coil. Switchable coupling between the coils allows the antenna response to switch from lower to higher frequency responses within the same Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band. A bandwidth of the same physical length antenna can be increased up to twice the bandwidth or for a fixed bandwidth, the antenna length can be shortened. For the high frequency band, when the secondary helix is disconnected from the primary helix, the primary coil operates as a interferer notch out to improve interference rejection, to reject unwanted signals from nearby radios transmitting in frequencies separated by duplex spacing, such as Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) and cellular Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication bands.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/92/bd/40/de64c72e97a298/US10910725-20210202-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/46/89/47/46442112386cfc/US10910725-20210202-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/4f/39/ce/9070b29f387ef6/US10910725-20210202-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6f/9d/ed/ff321db04806aa/US10910725-20210202-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/76/a9/50/8176338bc2bf9c/US10910725-20210202-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f1/29/96/3e1153bf60f844/US10910725-20210202-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e1/df/39/b164cbe92e92fb/US10910725-20210202-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/13/12/a8/0bf03897736df3/US10910725-20210202-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/bd/1c/56/5ef1affc1b0ea5/US10910725-20210202-D00008.png","Poh Imm Goh, Teik Yang Goh, Alexander Oon, Seow Teng Wong",Motorola Solutions Inc,"2016-05-16: Dual contra-wound helical antenna for a communication device, 2018-08-23: Adjusted expiration, 2019-03-07: Assigned to MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC., 2021-02-02: Application granted, Status: Publication of US10910725B2, 2036-06-29: Active","H, H01, H01Q, H01Q11/00, H01Q11/02, H01Q11/08, H, H01, H01Q, H01Q1/00, H01Q1/12, H01Q1/22, H01Q1/24, H01Q1/241, H01Q1/242, H, H01, H01Q, H01Q5/00, H01Q5/30, H01Q5/307","H—ELECTRICITYH01—ELECTRIC ELEMENTSH01Q—ANTENNAS, i.e. RADIO AERIALSH01Q11/00—Electrically-long antennas having dimensions more than twice the shortest operating wavelength and consisting of conductive active radiating elementsH01Q11/02—Non-resonant antennas, e.g. travelling-wave antennaH01Q11/08—Helical antennas, H—ELECTRICITY, H01—ELECTRIC ELEMENTS, H01Q—ANTENNAS, i.e. RADIO AERIALS, H01Q11/00—Electrically-long antennas having dimensions more than twice the shortest operating wavelength and consisting of conductive active radiating elements, H01Q11/02—Non-resonant antennas, e.g. travelling-wave antenna, H01Q11/08—Helical antennas, H—ELECTRICITYH01—ELECTRIC ELEMENTSH01Q—ANTENNAS, i.e. RADIO AERIALSH01Q1/00—Details of, or arrangements associated with, antennasH01Q1/12—Supports; Mounting meansH01Q1/22—Supports; Mounting means by structural association with other equipment or articlesH01Q1/24—Supports; Mounting means by structural association with other equipment or articles with receiving setH01Q1/241—Supports; Mounting means by structural association with other equipment or articles with receiving set used in mobile communications, e.g. GSMH01Q1/242—Supports; Mounting means by structural association with other equipment or articles with receiving set used in mobile communications, e.g. GSM specially adapted for hand-held use, H—ELECTRICITY, H01—ELECTRIC ELEMENTS, H01Q—ANTENNAS, i.e. RADIO AERIALS, H01Q1/00—Details of, or arrangements associated with, antennas, H01Q1/12—Supports; Mounting means, H01Q1/22—Supports; Mounting means by structural association with other equipment or articles, H01Q1/24—Supports; Mounting means by structural association with other equipment or articles with receiving set, H01Q1/241—Supports; Mounting means by structural association with other equipment or articles with receiving set used in mobile communications, e.g. GSM, H01Q1/242—Supports; Mounting means by structural association with other equipment or articles with receiving set used in mobile communications, e.g. GSM specially adapted for hand-held use, H—ELECTRICITYH01—ELECTRIC ELEMENTSH01Q—ANTENNAS, i.e. RADIO AERIALSH01Q5/00—Arrangements for simultaneous operation of antennas on two or more different wavebands, e.g. dual-band or multi-band arrangementsH01Q5/30—Arrangements for providing operation on different wavebandsH01Q5/307—Individual or coupled radiating elements, each element being fed in an unspecified way, H—ELECTRICITY, H01—ELECTRIC ELEMENTS, H01Q—ANTENNAS, i.e. RADIO AERIALS, H01Q5/00—Arrangements for simultaneous operation of antennas on two or more different wavebands, e.g. dual-band or multi-band arrangements, H01Q5/30—Arrangements for providing operation on different wavebands, H01Q5/307—Individual or coupled radiating elements, each element being fed in an unspecified way",

The first layer of peritoneal membrane can be located adjacent to a second layer of peritoneal membrane and can be in direct contact with the second layer of peritoneal membrane. Additional layers (e.g., a third or fourth layer) can be included. Where more than one layer is present, the layers can be affixed to one another. For example, a first layer of peritoneal membrane can be attached to the second layer of peritoneal membrane by an adhesive bond, suture, or staple. One or more of the peritoneal membranes can be non-crosslinked, partially crosslinked, or substantially fully crosslinked. Any of the layers of peritoneal membrane may be attached to a wall (e.g., an interior or exterior wall) of an abdominal tissue by an adhesive, suture, and/or staples.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/35/69/e9/160e8cb2230310/US10220114-20190305-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/57/a8/d3/7506edea8fc447/US10220114-20190305-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/13/ff/e7/9c1726ee3d7ec6/US10220114-20190305-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/79/70/b1/608c3afff63af2/US10220114-20190305-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f5/76/6c/cdeba21b9195b7/US10220114-20190305-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/5d/58/57/149417392188a7/US10220114-20190305-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c1/11/bf/d51f89bcd89e40/US10220114-20190305-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1e/7d/e6/eda8da6c76452d/US10220114-20190305-D00007.png","Peter Gingras, Gabriela Voskerician, Michael F.

Use of recombinant lymphocyte activation gene-3 as a companion therapeutic for patients at risk for cardiovascular disease and other chronic inflammatory diseases,US10265379B2,"A method for classifying patients at risk for cardiovascular disease, other chronic inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular and/or non-cardiovascular morbidity and mortality based on a risk assessment for lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) protein deficiency, and for mediating the risk using recombinant lymphocyte activation gene-3 or LAG3 mimetic as a companion therapeutic alone or in combination with a statin and/or an anti-hyperlipidemic drug. The risk assessment is two-prong, beginning with a qualitative determination whether a subject has or is predisposed to abnormal expression of inflammasomes, heightened risk for inflammation and/or to dysfunctional HDL, followed by a quantitative assay or genetic screen for a polymorphism that occurs in the coding sequence of the LAG3 gene. Given positive indication, recombinant LAG3 and/or LAG3 mimetic is used alone or in combination with the therapeutic use of a cholesterol mediating drug for treatment.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/61/21/e3/a85a1cdcb59fdc/US10265379-20190423-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ec/83/3e/d91b75d3913aee/US10265379-20190423-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e4/16/5e/b7332ea3107441/US10265379-20190423-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6d/9e/09/1926c149ff0c85/US10265379-20190423-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e3/26/4b/f5e3e40a41d415/US10265379-20190423-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e5/5a/b0/40722c6344f7d1/US10265379-20190423-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/8d/c9/0a/7752362e9aaa8e/US10265379-20190423-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1e/ca/aa/73fa6d64a0cd81/US10265379-20190423-D00008.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/dc/97/03/6444c6f3f142db/US10265379-20190423-D00009.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/27/58/89/f3fa5b05d7feb0/US10265379-20190423-D00010.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/27/88/b8/525c0e6a9a8bdd/US10265379-20190423-D00011.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/90/0f/25/2aa440b6d36434/US10265379-20190423-D00012.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/50/1a/20/b9ea7b563cb4fe/US10265379-20190423-D00013.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/79/82/c6/2008c5a432886d/US10265379-20190423-D00014.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e9/ba/f6/6457091e3c43b0/US10265379-20190423-D00015.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/65/a2/6d/71cb450f52cfcf/US10265379-20190423-D00016.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/87/73/28/b82335a2b65c9a/US10265379-20190423-D00017.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e7/2d/d7/c409fec27482ac/US10265379-20190423-D00018.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/72/f2/d0/f0ac8ec404184e/US10265379-20190423-D00019.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/61/24/ba/58848804a5731d/US10265379-20190423-D00020.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ae/b7/7b/aa954fcb046dac/US10265379-20190423-D00021.png",Annabelle Rodriguez Oquendo,Individual,"2016-09-12: Priority to US15/262,618, 2017-09-12: Priority to SG11201901993SA, 2017-11-02: Priority to CA3036090A, 2019-03-10: Publication of US20170312338A1, 2019-03-21: Priority to IL265258A, 2019-04-23: Application granted, 2023-12-14: Publication of US10265379B2, Status: Priority to AU2023282264A, 2036-09-12: Active, 2018-04-05: Anticipated expiration","A, A61, A61K, A61K38/00, A61K38/16, A61K38/17, A61K38/177, A61K38/1774, A, A61, A61K, A61K31/00, A61K31/095, A, A61, A61K, A61K31/00, A61K31/095, A61K31/10, A, A61, A61K, A61K45/00, A61K45/06, A, A61, A61P, A61P29/00, A, A61, A61P, A61P3/00, A61P3/06, A, A61, A61P, A61P37/00, A61P37/02, A, A61, A61P, A61P43/00, A, A61, A61P, A61P9/00, A, A61, A61P, A61P9/00, A61P9/10, C, C12, C12Q, C12Q1/00, C12Q1/68, C12Q1/6876, C12Q1/6883, G, G01, G01N, G01N33/00, G01N33/48, G01N33/50, G01N33/68, G01N33/6872, G, G01, G01N, G01N33/00, G01N33/48, G01N33/50, G01N33/68, G01N33/6893, C, C12, C12Q, C12Q2600/00, C12Q2600/156, G, G01, G01N, G01N2333/00, G01N2333/435, G01N2333/705, G01N2333/70503, G, G01, G01N, G01N2800/00, G01N2800/32","A—HUMAN NECESSITIESA61—MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE;

An optical element is patterned and a contaminant-gettering material is formed on a surface of the optical element. In one embodiment, a photoresist is deposited on an optical coating on the optical element. Trenches are formed in the optical coating. The gettering agent is formed into the trenches over the photoresist. Next, the photoresist is removed from the optical coating to expose the gettering agent in the trenches. For another embodiment, patches of a nanotube forest having a gettering agent are formed in designated areas of an optical element. The gettering agent of the patches may be a plurality of carbon nanotubes. The optical coating is formed on a substrate between patches of the gettering agent.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/98/3b/87/5c0afe4af48131/US20060216912A1-20060928-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0f/2b/9e/549a977c4484cd/US20060216912A1-20060928-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/bb/e4/9e/c3452304ea4646/US20060216912A1-20060928-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/bd/b7/a1/e891978d734932/US20060216912A1-20060928-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/47/9f/c9/a188e22b896ba0/US20060216912A1-20060928-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/8d/d4/bb/67d4cf42961b09/US20060216912A1-20060928-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/23/5a/e0/740a497dd23bfa/US20060216912A1-20060928-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/bf/61/c5/32162d09a29986/US20060216912A1-20060928-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1a/92/37/96a8fd33ab9c82/US20060216912A1-20060928-D00008.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/4b/66/f4/a1181ec81f391e/US20060216912A1-20060928-D00009.png","Robert Bristol, Bruce Billett",Intel Corp,"2005-03-28: Adjusted expiration, 2006-09-28: Assigned to INTEL CORPORATION, 2007-12-14: Publication of US20060216912A1, 2008-02-19: Application granted, Status: Publication of US7332416B2, 2025-05-10: Expired - Fee Related","G, G21, G21K, G21K1/00, G21K1/06, G, G21, G21K, G21K2201/00, G21K2201/06, G21K2201/067","G—PHYSICSG21—NUCLEAR PHYSICS; NUCLEAR ENGINEERINGG21K—TECHNIQUES FOR HANDLING PARTICLES OR IONISING RADIATION NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR; IRRADIATION DEVICES; GAMMA RAY OR X-RAY MICROSCOPESG21K1/00—Arrangements for handling particles or ionising radiation, e.g. focusing or moderatingG21K1/06—Arrangements for handling particles or ionising radiation, e.g. focusing or moderating using diffraction, refraction or reflection, e.g. monochromators, G—PHYSICS, G21—NUCLEAR PHYSICS; NUCLEAR ENGINEERING, G21K—TECHNIQUES FOR HANDLING PARTICLES OR IONISING RADIATION NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR; IRRADIATION DEVICES; GAMMA RAY OR X-RAY MICROSCOPES, G21K1/00—Arrangements for handling particles or ionising radiation, e.g. focusing or moderating, G21K1/06—Arrangements for handling particles or ionising radiation, e.g. focusing or moderating using diffraction, refraction or reflection, e.g. monochromators, G—PHYSICSG21—NUCLEAR PHYSICS; NUCLEAR ENGINEERINGG21K—TECHNIQUES FOR HANDLING PARTICLES OR IONISING RADIATION NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR; IRRADIATION DEVICES; GAMMA RAY OR X-RAY MICROSCOPESG21K2201/00—Arrangements for handling radiation or particlesG21K2201/06—Arrangements for handling radiation or particles using diffractive, refractive or reflecting elementsG21K2201/067—Construction details, G—PHYSICS, G21—NUCLEAR PHYSICS; NUCLEAR ENGINEERING, G21K—TECHNIQUES FOR HANDLING PARTICLES OR IONISING RADIATION NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR; IRRADIATION DEVICES; GAMMA RAY OR X-RAY MICROSCOPES, G21K2201/00—Arrangements for handling radiation or particles, G21K2201/06—Arrangements for handling radiation or particles using diffractive, refractive or reflecting elements, G21K2201/067—Construction details",

Treating alcohol and or substance abuse by antagonizing alpha 2 adrenergic receptors with weak dopamine blocking,US20060189599A1,"Certain atypical antipsychotic medications (particularly clozapine) or combinations of medications are useful to treat alcohol or other substance abuse, particularly in the general (non-schizophrenic) population. Generally stated, one aspect of the invention features a method of treating a patient suffering from alcohol or other substance abuse by administering to the patient medication effective to rectify an abuse-associated dysfunction in the DA-mediated brain reward circuit. A second aspect of the invention features administering medication that strongly antagonizes α2 andrenergic receptors and weakly antagonizes dopamine D2 receptors. Preferably, the ratio of α2 receptor blockade to D2o receptor blockade is similar to that of clozapine. The medication may be a single compound (such as clozapine or risperidone), or it may include two or more compounds which together achieve the specified function. For example, the medication may include a first component which weakly blocks the D2 receptor (such as clozapine, quetiapine or ziprasidone or a low dose of another anti-psychotic that is a more potent D2 blocker) and a5 second component (such as clozapine, risperidone or idazoxan) which strongly blocks α2 receptors, particularly the α2C receptor. Cocktails of the two components are also disclosed.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/80/9c/d0/e3c290b3aca6da/US20060189599A1-20060824-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/4a/f6/dc/5ecdbcf4212ff6/US20060189599A1-20060824-D00002.png","Alan Green, Wing Keung, Joseph Schildkraut, David Chau",Individual,"2003-10-17: Application filed by Individual, 2006-08-24: Priority to US10/531,523, 2009-08-05: Publication of US20060189599A1, Status: Priority to US12/536,143, 2009-10-26: Abandoned","A, A61, A61K, A61K31/00, A61K31/33, A61K31/395, A61K31/55, A61K31/551, A61K31/5513, A, A61, A61K, A61K31/00, A61K31/33, A61K31/395, A61K31/41, A61K31/415, A, A61, A61P, A61P25/00, A61P25/30, A, A61, A61P, A61P25/00, A61P25/30, A61P25/32","A—HUMAN NECESSITIESA61—MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE; HYGIENEA61K—PREPARATIONS FOR MEDICAL, DENTAL OR TOILETRY PURPOSESA61K31/00—Medicinal preparations containing organic active ingredientsA61K31/33—Heterocyclic compoundsA61K31/395—Heterocyclic compounds having nitrogen as a ring hetero atom, e.g. guanethidine or rifamycinsA61K31/55—Heterocyclic compounds having nitrogen as a ring hetero atom, e.g. guanethidine or rifamycins having seven-membered rings, e.g. azelastine, pentylenetetrazoleA61K31/551—Heterocyclic compounds having nitrogen as a ring hetero atom, e.g. guanethidine or rifamycins having seven-membered rings, e.g. azelastine, pentylenetetrazole having two nitrogen atoms, e.g. dilazepA61K31/5513—1,4-Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam or clozapine, A—HUMAN NECESSITIES, A61—MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE; HYGIENE, A61K—PREPARATIONS FOR MEDICAL, DENTAL OR TOILETRY PURPOSES, A61K31/00—Medicinal preparations containing organic active ingredients, A61K31/33—Heterocyclic compounds, A61K31/395—Heterocyclic compounds having nitrogen as a ring hetero atom, e.g. guanethidine or rifamycins, A61K31/55—Heterocyclic compounds having nitrogen as a ring hetero atom, e.g. guanethidine or rifamycins having seven-membered rings, e.g. azelastine, pentylenetetrazole, A61K31/551—Heterocyclic compounds having nitrogen as a ring hetero atom, e.g. guanethidine or rifamycins having seven-membered rings, e.g. azelastine, pentylenetetrazole having two nitrogen atoms, e.g. dilazep, A61K31/5513—1,4-Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam or clozapine, A—HUMAN NECESSITIESA61—MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE; HYGIENEA61K—PREPARATIONS FOR MEDICAL, DENTAL OR TOILETRY PURPOSESA61K31/00—Medicinal preparations containing organic active ingredientsA61K31/33—Heterocyclic compoundsA61K31/395—Heterocyclic compounds having nitrogen as a ring hetero atom, e.g. guanethidine or rifamycinsA61K31/41—Heterocyclic compounds having nitrogen as a ring hetero atom, e.g. guanethidine or rifamycins having five-membered rings with two or more ring hetero atoms, at least one of which being nitrogen, e.g. tetrazoleA61K31/415—1,2-Diazoles, A—HUMAN NECESSITIES, A61—MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE; HYGIENE, A61K—PREPARATIONS FOR MEDICAL, DENTAL OR TOILETRY PURPOSES, A61K31/00—Medicinal preparations containing organic active ingredients, A61K31/33—Heterocyclic compounds, A61K31/395—Heterocyclic compounds having nitrogen as a ring hetero atom, e.g. guanethidine or rifamycins, A61K31/41—Heterocyclic compounds having nitrogen as a ring hetero atom, e.g. guanethidine or rifamycins having five-membered rings with two or more ring hetero atoms, at least one of which being nitrogen, e.g. tetrazole, A61K31/415—1,2-Diazoles, A—HUMAN NECESSITIESA61—MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE; HYGIENEA61P—SPECIFIC THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITY OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS OR MEDICINAL PREPARATIONSA61P25/00—Drugs for disorders of the nervous systemA61P25/30—Drugs for disorders of the nervous system for treating abuse or dependence, A—HUMAN NECESSITIES, A61—MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE; HYGIENE, A61P—SPECIFIC THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITY OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS OR MEDICINAL PREPARATIONS, A61P25/00—Drugs for disorders of the nervous system, A61P25/30—Drugs for disorders of the nervous system for treating abuse or dependence, A—HUMAN NECESSITIESA61—MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE; HYGIENEA61P—SPECIFIC THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITY OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS OR MEDICINAL PREPARATIONSA61P25/00—Drugs for disorders of the nervous systemA61P25/30—Drugs for disorders of the nervous system for treating abuse or dependenceA61P25/32—Alcohol-abuse, A—HUMAN NECESSITIES, A61—MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE; HYGIENE, A61P—SPECIFIC THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITY OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS OR MEDICINAL PREPARATIONS, A61P25/00—Drugs for disorders of the nervous system, A61P25/30—Drugs for disorders of the nervous system for treating abuse or dependence, A61P25/32—Alcohol-abuse",

Splitable tip catheter with bioresorbable adhesive,US20050277862A1,"Splitable-tip catheters are disclosed with bioresorbable adhesive to provide spatial separation of distal tip elements during use. The invention can be particularly useful in hemodialysis applications where it is desirable to separate blood extraction and return lumens. The adhesive facilitates insertion of the distal end of the catheter as an assembly, e.g., into a blood vessel using a single guidewire, while the bioresorbable nature of the adhesive allows the tip elements to separate in vivo.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/90/67/6a/348b95c78a577e/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/27/a1/dc/38654f6fed8b03/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6b/d6/0a/fdaaf084ce2769/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/38/ec/e4/7e07ec465c98ec/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a8/d6/b3/6b01ba7ae41600/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c6/23/f0/ba1a0f472a56e4/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a5/8d/05/34f11e1bc4556e/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/99/08/59/4eb7ab720d71d8/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/59/ce/01/2a9346acfa47bc/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00008.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/be/f1/ed/74f9c82493d0e7/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00009.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/9d/bf/6a/1fdde73f44318b/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00010.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/55/67/f1/6a1bce5f07f3c7/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00011.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ca/a1/10/6ef4d29ffd3af8/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00012.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/73/de/6b/69ae9cfe00d7ea/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00013.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/54/f6/12/1b3eafba93c878/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00014.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/8b/a8/8d/c76d7578e6d2c3/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00015.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ba/8a/55/2230243aa5a1db/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00016.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/dd/98/3c/817246bc8c772c/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00017.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/24/9c/44/8a61aadcc8c4d2/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00018.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/38/0f/4b/5f010edcda5fd0/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00019.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/5b/5e/95/48f6e186770fee/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00020.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/fa/d0/cd/03671edf84134d/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00021.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1d/86/fb/d73ab683674267/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00022.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/28/12/c6/26f78783a55211/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00023.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/4d/89/9d/95ea843a3b339f/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00024.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f0/81/d5/d0b6e13a090fb3/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00025.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/04/91/9f/d28d12967fddec/US20050277862A1-20051215-D00026.png",PJ Anand,Bard Access Systems Inc,"2004-06-09: Application filed by Spire Corp, 2004-09-27: Adjusted expiration, 2005-12-15: Assigned to SPIRE CORPORATION, 2008-03-14: Publication of US20050277862A1, 2010-02-01: Priority to US12/048,871, 2015-03-31: Priority to US14/675,236, Status: Publication of US8992454B2, 2028-09-01: Active","A, A61, A61M, A61M1/00, A61M1/36, A61M1/3621, A61M1/3653, A61M1/3659, A61M1/3661, A, A61, A61M, A61M1/00, A61M1/14, A61M1/28, A61M1/285, A, A61, A61M, A61M25/00, A61M25/0021, A61M25/0023, A61M25/0026, A, A61, A61M, A61M25/00, A61M25/0021, A61M25/0023, A61M25/0026, A61M25/003, A, A61, A61M, A61M25/00, A61M25/0067, A61M25/0068, A, A61, A61M, A61M25/00, A61M25/0067, A61M25/0068, A61M25/0071, A, A61, A61M, A61M25/00, A61M25/0021, A61M25/0023, A61M25/0026, A61M25/003, A61M2025/0031, A, A61, A61M, A61M25/00, A61M25/0021, A61M25/0023, A61M25/0026, A61M2025/0034, A, A61, A61M, A61M25/00, A61M25/01, A61M2025/0188, A, A61, A61M, A61M25/00, A61M25/0021, A61M25/0023, A61M25/0026, A61M25/0032, A, A61, A61M, A61M25/00, A61M25/0067, A61M25/0068, A61M25/007, A, A61, A61M, A61M25/00, A61M25/0067, A61M25/0074, A, A61, A61M, A61M25/00, A61M25/0067, A61M25/008","A—HUMAN NECESSITIESA61—MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE;

Patch-like infusion device,US20040138612A1,"A system and method for a patch-like, self-contained substance infusion device which provides one or more substantially hidden patient needles which can be placed in fluid communication with a fluid reservoir subassembly that includes a rigid bladder portion used in conjunction with a non-distensible bladder film, such as a metallized film. Simple removal of an interlock allows a disk, or Belleville spring assembly to apply an essentially even and constant pressure to the contents of the fluid reservoir assembly, and allows the device to then be attached to a skin surface via an adhesive contact surface. A push button activation assembly is provided which can then be used to release and seat one or more spring-loaded patient needles into the skin surface, and establish a fluid communication path between the patient needles and the pressurized fluid reservoir contents thereby delivering an infusion into the skin.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c7/94/9a/81b7325625db9b/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/25/72/d9/2ccb127346740c/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ea/cf/39/0680dd2127de11/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/62/df/b1/c187be14f6af58/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/99/3a/49/ab6dc88a02926b/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/37/ff/21/bb8d3ddd707f79/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d5/73/a3/f9837ddf85b80a/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/b9/03/09/e393fc3126219f/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/20/a8/35/fa5d8cb6d8b24f/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00008.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/02/a9/d2/7c5d3dfc7d64f6/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00009.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0e/0d/4a/c919cdade65ea5/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00010.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/41/6f/e9/ecd342b6c90b15/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00011.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/34/e2/80/2e8e7164748b3a/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00012.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c2/a4/7f/90b72b94d39d65/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00013.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/de/37/30/fc3bb121eef8f9/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00014.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/86/57/8f/f4055274834135/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00015.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e0/bb/45/7d1764c161dbdc/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00016.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/14/58/8d/394dd359b746dc/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00017.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/56/02/49/e71f8d12aa684d/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00018.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/8e/85/e2/deaebc7a304a9e/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00019.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/af/92/84/2c32778a7e7987/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00020.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c4/9a/4b/1264c80cb975c4/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00021.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/54/c4/8c/f8d4c7ac8a839c/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00022.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7d/e1/c9/2a0adb6dbb5cab/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00023.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/03/13/52/2b3a748a284f67/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00024.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/5a/b9/9d/29e9488b8d66fe/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00025.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/72/95/e7/15133df542dc79/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00026.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d4/17/11/6a88f22999411d/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00027.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/82/29/25/0a7339075fef73/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00028.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7d/96/26/9609f0ed84c6b7/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00029.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/9e/af/3f/da5d6923fa7df8/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00030.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/12/26/25/96e5a59be36009/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00031.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/17/21/99/1f4bb060f8ab0d/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00032.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e9/83/08/4fe8433167778c/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00033.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d4/db/33/680a5c19ac72dd/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00034.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/02/26/fd/7c739cf9a818f1/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00035.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c4/39/0d/c962397669ab8c/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00036.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/52/d3/5a/ac1433952c0cea/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00037.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/36/57/48/af6556104eb3c8/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00038.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/38/16/40/24c204833feaa0/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00039.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/9c/f8/00/e124631b9374b4/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00040.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/bd/52/69/a16815ed3f863e/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00041.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7e/be/8f/d3a5aab7409ce8/US20040138612A1-20040715-D00042.png","Charles Shermer, Kenneth Powell, Alexander Lastovich, P.

Locating Blood Vessels,US20090245601A1,Several systems and methods for locating blood vessels are described in the present disclosure. One of the implementations of a blood vessel locating system comprises an image capture device and processing circuitry. The image capture device is configured to capture a first image of a region of the skin of a subject when the region is illuminated by a first light and to capture a second image of the region of the skin when the region is illuminated by a second light. The processing circuitry is configured to calculate the difference between the first image and the second image to obtain a differential image. The processing circuitry is further configured to enhance the differential image to obtain an enhanced image of blood vessels located under the surface of the skin of the subject.,"https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0c/fd/07/d85b991fd5e4c9/US20090245601A1-20091001-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/3c/d4/bb/a023fe9cfe1f11/US20090245601A1-20091001-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/05/88/e9/89ae72fa01d4ae/US20090245601A1-20091001-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/8e/f8/41/861cde9a37396c/US20090245601A1-20091001-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/8e/97/72/816298aead02f9/US20090245601A1-20091001-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1b/5f/e9/aea261729463b3/US20090245601A1-20091001-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e7/07/bb/19388b2a1f3491/US20090245601A1-20091001-D00006.png","Robert F.

"System and method for delivery, conformation and removal of intramedullary bone fixation devices",US20080269747A1,"The present invention provides a bone fixation device for implantation into the intramedullary canal of a bone. The bone fixation device may include a support structure and a thermo-chemically activated matrix. The support structure may be radially expandable and contractible, and sufficiently flexible to be inserted into the intramedullary canal through an opening which is not parallel to the intramedullary canal. The matrix may attain a first thermo-chemical state via the addition of energy, and a second thermo-chemical state via the dissipation of energy. While in the first thermo-chemical state, the matrix is deformable and can conform to a shape matching the contours of the intramedullary canal of the bone. As the matrix attains the second thermo-chemical state, it may crystallize and becomes relatively hardened. An implant deformation apparatus may be used to expand the device within the intramedullary canal.

Food ingredient comprising functional peptide,US20110009345A1,"With efficient extracting of peptide from coffee bean, and by providing food ingredient in which small quantity of peptide is uniformly dispersed by harmless means or dispersing means, the peptide is easily orally ingested. That is, so much material and long time is required for extracting. And, quantity of novel ingredient of peptide obtainable by the extracting is very small, so it is difficult to use the ingredient as it is for material of medicine or food. So, it is inevitable to disperse uniformly in harmless extender. And, for example, solubility of vegetable peptide is generally much influenced by pH or concentration of salt (ion intensity), so particularly in acidic zone, solubility of it deteriorates and it deposits or coheres, ingestion by oral administration of it mixed with food is not always easy, so it is required to disperse the peptide uniformly in harmless means or dispersing means.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0d/91/62/a8cd058a0364cd/US20110009345A1-20110113-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ab/66/b9/2305e1e28140b0/US20110009345A1-20110113-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/69/6f/bd/dfb7f200430ab2/US20110009345A1-20110113-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a6/27/1e/029c766cbb7dc3/US20110009345A1-20110113-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ee/4d/23/13e25304f7b158/US20110009345A1-20110113-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/11/86/38/6d9fedf9ccc9bf/US20110009345A1-20110113-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/3b/b0/c5/ec7be6383807a6/US20110009345A1-20110113-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e1/df/4c/85a9584ff1007d/US20110009345A1-20110113-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/37/06/02/b55dc543971231/US20110009345A1-20110113-D00008.png",Henry Aoki,Individual,"2009-07-08: Application filed by Individual, 2011-01-13: Priority to US12/459,926, Status: Publication of US20110009345A1, 2012-04-23: Abandoned","A, A23, A23L, A23L33/00, A23L33/10, A23L33/17, A23L33/18, A, A23, A23V, A23V2002/00","A—HUMAN NECESSITIESA23—FOODS OR FOODSTUFFS; TREATMENT THEREOF, NOT COVERED BY OTHER CLASSESA23L—FOODS, FOODSTUFFS, OR NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES, NOT COVERED BY SUBCLASSES A21D OR A23B-A23J; THEIR PREPARATION OR TREATMENT, e.g. COOKING, MODIFICATION OF NUTRITIVE QUALITIES, PHYSICAL TREATMENT; PRESERVATION OF FOODS OR FOODSTUFFS, IN GENERALA23L33/00—Modifying nutritive qualities of foods; Dietetic products; Preparation or treatment thereofA23L33/10—Modifying nutritive qualities of foods; Dietetic products; Preparation or treatment thereof using additivesA23L33/17—Amino acids, peptides or proteinsA23L33/18—Peptides; Protein hydrolysates, A—HUMAN NECESSITIES, A23—FOODS OR FOODSTUFFS; TREATMENT THEREOF, NOT COVERED BY OTHER CLASSES, A23L—FOODS, FOODSTUFFS, OR NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES, NOT COVERED BY SUBCLASSES A21D OR A23B-A23J; THEIR PREPARATION OR TREATMENT, e.g. COOKING, MODIFICATION OF NUTRITIVE QUALITIES, PHYSICAL TREATMENT; PRESERVATION OF FOODS OR FOODSTUFFS, IN GENERAL, A23L33/00—Modifying nutritive qualities of foods; Dietetic products; Preparation or treatment thereof, A23L33/10—Modifying nutritive qualities of foods; Dietetic products; Preparation or treatment thereof using additives, A23L33/17—Amino acids, peptides or proteins, A23L33/18—Peptides; Protein hydrolysates, A—HUMAN NECESSITIESA23—FOODS OR FOODSTUFFS; TREATMENT THEREOF, NOT COVERED BY OTHER CLASSESA23V—INDEXING SCHEME RELATING TO FOODS, FOODSTUFFS OR NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND LACTIC OR PROPIONIC ACID BACTERIA USED IN FOODSTUFFS OR FOOD PREPARATIONA23V2002/00—Food compositions, function of food ingredients or processes for food or foodstuffs, A—HUMAN NECESSITIES, A23—FOODS OR FOODSTUFFS; TREATMENT THEREOF, NOT COVERED BY OTHER CLASSES, A23V—INDEXING SCHEME RELATING TO FOODS, FOODSTUFFS OR NON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND LACTIC OR PROPIONIC ACID BACTERIA USED IN FOODSTUFFS OR FOOD PREPARATION, A23V2002/00—Food compositions, function of food ingredients or processes for food or foodstuffs",

Configurable pliable air ducts,US20120006442A1,"In some example pliable air duct systems, inflatable ducts of various diameters and lengths are created by selectively assembling pre-existing stock pieces in different combinations. In some examples, the stock pieces include disconnectable longitudinal joints and disconnectable circumferential joints, wherein the longitudinal joints enable interconnecting multiple stock pieces to achieve a desired tube diameter, and the circumferential joints allow connecting multiple tube segments end-to-end to produce an air duct assembly of a desired length. To control the volume and/or the direction of air discharged from the duct, the duct assembly, in some examples, includes an adjustable register comprising a movable pliable sheet that overlies a discharge opening in a pliable sidewall of the duct. In some examples, the inflatable duct includes one or more cutout patterns on the duct's sidewall to provide guidance in creating a sidewall discharge opening of a proper size and location.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/98/2e/36/e3d62dfe46c648/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f9/39/2a/357ef41ca58fd3/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c0/18/de/1ab3fe228b9a30/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/21/7a/17/0f78f5d406cd60/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/5e/aa/dc/64ef219c8a54a7/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/22/d6/da/576275b3527600/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/34/3b/e6/cbbce452397dcd/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/16/26/18/13264e1ed8e183/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d0/19/79/46afc8550ade26/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00008.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ff/4b/73/69b09adb0a00e1/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00009.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/28/37/1f/89ee2b6e33d7a1/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00010.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/38/64/1b/8c79b4c778aa78/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00011.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/89/ee/a7/2b19b80b51bcb5/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00012.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ec/be/02/b6f446d3f907af/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00013.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e8/4b/48/2c13a77fffd611/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00014.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e1/bc/55/bb7c5a5975f0ea/US20120006442A1-20120112-D00015.png","Kevin J.

Containment coefficient for identifying textual subsets,US20120051657A1,"Similarity is determined between documents based on a method for identifying documents that are likely to be based on another document. The method can include the determination of a containment coefficient, which can indicate when a template document is a subset or substantially a subset of another document. Based on this determination, an appropriate document management action can be taken, such as implementing a security policy or modifying the display of messages from a user interface.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/91/ab/b9/7621295c43f91d/US20120051657A1-20120301-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/9f/99/7e/d552507c8718a5/US20120051657A1-20120301-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/36/62/48/e469b1dd490c81/US20120051657A1-20120301-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/89/b7/31/3ad68adfcbcc3e/US20120051657A1-20120301-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/78/3f/e4/917d47541c410e/US20120051657A1-20120301-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/99/2c/92/826a1788d3429d/US20120051657A1-20120301-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/5e/95/5b/291c1376819efc/US20120051657A1-20120301-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/33/c2/12/62ad5a85916a76/US20120051657A1-20120301-D00007.png","Charles Lamanna, Raja Charu Vikram Kakumani, Vidyaraman Sankaranarayanan, Arnd Christian König",Microsoft Technology Licensing LLC,"2010-08-30: Application filed by Microsoft Corp, 2010-09-02: Abandoned, 2012-03-01: Assigned to MICROSOFT CORPORATION, 2014-12-09: Containment coefficient for identifying textual subsets, Status: Assigned to MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGY LICENSING, LLC, 2014-02-04: Containment coefficient for identifying textual subsets","G, G06, G06F, G06F40/00, G06F40/10, G06F40/12, G06F40/131, G, G06, G06F, G06F40/00, G06F40/10, G06F40/194","G—PHYSICSG06—COMPUTING; CALCULATING OR COUNTINGG06F—ELECTRIC DIGITAL DATA PROCESSINGG06F40/00—Handling natural language dataG06F40/10—Text processingG06F40/12—Use of codes for handling textual entitiesG06F40/131—Fragmentation of text files, e.g. creating reusable text-blocks; Linking to fragments, e.g. using XInclude; Namespaces, G—PHYSICS, G06—COMPUTING; CALCULATING OR COUNTING, G06F—ELECTRIC DIGITAL DATA PROCESSING, G06F40/00—Handling natural language data, G06F40/10—Text processing, G06F40/12—Use of codes for handling textual entities, G06F40/131—Fragmentation of text files, e.g. creating reusable text-blocks; Linking to fragments, e.g. using XInclude; Namespaces, G—PHYSICSG06—COMPUTING; CALCULATING OR COUNTINGG06F—ELECTRIC DIGITAL DATA PROCESSINGG06F40/00—Handling natural language dataG06F40/10—Text processingG06F40/194—Calculation of difference between files, G—PHYSICS, G06—COMPUTING; CALCULATING OR COUNTING, G06F—ELECTRIC DIGITAL DATA PROCESSING, G06F40/00—Handling natural language data, G06F40/10—Text processing, G06F40/194—Calculation of difference between files",

Method to predict response to pharmacological chaperone treatment of diseases,US20110152319A1,The present invention provides methods to determine whether a patient with a lysosomal storage disorder will benefit from treatment with a specific pharmacological chaperone. The present invention exemplifies an in vitro method for determining α-galactosidase A responsiveness to a pharmacological chaperone such as 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin in a cell line expressing a mutant from of α-galactosidase A. The invention also provides a method for diagnosing Fabry disease in patients suspected of having Fabry disease.,"https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/69/8f/4f/7d64474ee102db/US20110152319A1-20110623-D00001.png,

Compositions for inducing differentiation into retinal cells from retinal progenitor cells or inducing proliferation of retinal cells comprising wnt signaling pathway activators,US20110223660A1,"Disclosed is a composition for inducing the proliferation of retinal cells or the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells into retinal cells. The composition, similar to in vivo conditions for development during embryogenesis, induces stem cells to differentiate into a multitude of photoreceptor cells at high yield within a short period of time, without an additional gene transfer. In addition, the differentiated photoreceptor cells are useful in cellular therapy because they, when transplanted into degenerated or injured retinas, can be engrafted and fused within the retinas to prevent or cure retinal degeneration.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/db/47/3d/8a50dab2b4ffc6/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/01/d4/a2/87061e950bed15/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/74/54/0b/651e84285c126b/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/9a/73/92/894e4c45722cc7/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/60/53/ff/fe9fd475de4b50/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f4/0c/92/b9bfb727497eaf/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/cc/c2/9a/c63ec2445f8057/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0e/16/5a/7b1a8b8ea731b3/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/33/9d/58/9d6d90859045fd/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00008.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/16/04/c5/1ae453a02c8953/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00009.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/9f/6a/c8/54b949b9584d43/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00010.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/2e/84/50/27983b7318dc25/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00011.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d4/45/19/fcccb55e39d821/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00012.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/72/10/ba/dba5928ed770f5/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00014.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/bf/a9/3b/2bf7441dd74952/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00015.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/41/f9/4a/5d72914d238495/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00016.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/fa/90/97/d0aaa507499db4/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00017.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/4f/ba/79/e84ae0c86305ac/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00018.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/29/f4/be/aafb86e3401f8a/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00019.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/4d/26/dc/a4526ac521dc1e/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00020.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/60/0d/45/7c14695428e948/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00021.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/37/5b/c2/ae9f7ca556972f/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00022.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6e/69/d5/1a9cb7963695ac/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00023.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/1d/a5/40/bc512cd47c6d36/US20110223660A1-20110915-D00024.png","Sung Sup Park, Ji Yeon Kim",Clavistherapeutics Inc,"2010-10-06: Compositions for inducing differentiation into retinal cells from retinal progenitor cells or inducing proliferation of retinal cells comprising wnt signaling pathway activators, 2011-01-25: Adjusted expiration, 2011-09-15: Assigned to SNU R&DB FOUNDATION, 2015-12-01: Application granted, 2021-09-14: Publication of US9200252B2, Status: Assigned to CLAVISTHERAPEUTICS, INC., 2031-12-26: Active","C, C12, C12N, C12N5/00, C12N5/06, C12N5/0602, C12N5/0618, C12N5/062, A, A61, A61K, A61K35/00, A61K35/12, C, C12, C12N, C12N2500/00, C12N2500/30, C12N2500/44, C, C12, C12N, C12N2501/00, C12N2501/10, C12N2501/105, C, C12, C12N, C12N2501/00, C12N2501/10, C12N2501/115, C, C12, C12N, C12N2501/00, C12N2501/10, C12N2501/155, C, C12, C12N, C12N2501/00, C12N2501/30, C12N2501/38, C12N2501/385, C, C12, C12N, C12N2501/00, C12N2501/40, C12N2501/41, C, C12, C12N, C12N2501/00, C12N2501/40, C12N2501/415, C, C12, C12N, C12N2506/00, C12N2506/02, C, C12, C12N, C12N2506/00, C12N2506/45","C—CHEMISTRY;

Analyte Monitoring Device and Methods of Use,US20100268044A1,"An analyte monitor includes a sensor, a sensor control unit, and a display unit. The sensor has, for example, a substrate, a recessed channel formed in the substrate, and conductive material disposed in the recessed channel to form a working electrode. The sensor control unit typically has a housing adapted for placement on skin and is adapted to receive a portion of an electrochemical sensor. The sensor control unit also includes two or more conductive contacts disposed on the housing and configured for coupling to two or more contact pads on the sensor. A transmitter is disposed in the housing and coupled to the plurality of conductive contacts for transmitting data obtained using the sensor. The display unit has a receiver for receiving data transmitted by the transmitter of the sensor control unit and a display coupled to the receiver for displaying an indication of a level of an analyte. The analyte monitor may also be part of a drug delivery system to alter the level of the analyte based on the data obtained using the sensor.","https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6a/76/97/424029cc857e76/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00000.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f2/57/c9/5b8b8431d5d548/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00001.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0a/a8/d6/5fa2509ed2420b/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00002.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/47/20/43/253a25e63201bb/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00003.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/14/1f/be/cb338c4ba2d7d8/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00004.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c5/5f/06/0e2332ae9c2fff/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00005.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/40/3a/e0/cce94a35cadb1e/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00006.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c1/1c/d8/cd13ca46875a8c/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00007.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a8/f3/8a/8c8b7ab91e0043/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00008.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7b/1b/47/b35076d91b893d/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00009.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/69/7d/40/fee7a3d1dddde9/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00010.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/5b/0a/61/7376f8e11caadd/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00011.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/60/50/8d/ce054e46a5ffba/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00012.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/26/f8/97/6849c39f55534c/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00013.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/53/0d/13/4baed8e0b6e48b/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00014.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/54/ff/16/98e91346948978/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00015.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/df/68/07/81e26b7a74f173/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00016.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/bd/e9/fe/e60ddd2c3347d8/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00017.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/56/33/66/c13a5d415f7663/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00018.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/63/2e/fd/beddcfc358a4c5/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00019.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7f/24/23/2679ab90b98631/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00020.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/dd/72/0e/be8e513c1dadab/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00021.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/c0/0e/a8/2d8e230d78a425/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00022.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/25/7c/a2/d08e7c3fa6339a/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00023.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/3f/e6/64/672ac2486f7795/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00024.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/8d/1f/72/15577f13540ba2/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00025.png, https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/27/95/75/aedaab5763bbf5/US20100268044A1-20101021-D00026.png","James Say, Michael F.
